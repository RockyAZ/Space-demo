# Space-demo
Demo scene in space with planet surrounding by meteorite field

All textures and models borrowedfrom internet, I created everything else.
Meteorite field drawing with instance-drawing method.
Earth and stars in endless universes rendering with cubemap(skybox) method.
Main planet and moving meteorites near planet have collision effect with bullets that you can release by pressing left mouse button.
Also you can move pressing WASD(directions), Shift(down), and Space bar(up).
